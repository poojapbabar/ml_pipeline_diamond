## End-to-End Project Setup Steps:
### Step 1: Create a new environment
```
conda create -p venv python==3.8
conda activate venv/
```

### Step 2: Create a .gitignore file
```Create the file by right-clicking and include the venv in it.```

### Step 3: Create a requirements.txt file
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Step 4: Create a setup.py file
```
This is to install the entire project as a package. Additionally, write a function to read the packages from requirements.txt
```

### Step 5: Create a folder src
```
Include exception, logger, and utils python files. Make this folder a package by including init.py file. The src folder will include another folder named components. Include init.py also.
```

#### Step 5.1: Create a folder of components
```
Include data_ingestion, data_transformation, model trainer, and init.py. These components are to be interconnected in the future.
```
#### Step 5.2: Create a folder called pipeline
```Create two python files training_pipeline and prediction_pipeline with init.py folder.```

### Step 6: Create a folder called notebooks
``` Create a folder called data and include the dataset. Additionally, create an EDA.ipynb file to do the initial exploratory data analysis. ```

### Step 7: Data Ingestion
```Write code or scripts to ingest the dataset into the project. You can use tools like pandas, SQL queries, or APIs.```

### Step 8: Data Transformation
``` Perform data preprocessing and transformation steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features, etc.```

### Step 9: Model Training
``` Develop and train machine learning models using the preprocessed data. Experiment with different algorithms and techniques to achieve the best performance.```

### Step 10: Model Evaluation
``` Evaluate the performance of trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics. Visualize the results to gain insights into model performance.```

### Step 11: Model Deployment
``` Deploy the trained models into production or make them accessible for inference. This can involve creating APIs, deploying on cloud platforms, or packaging the models for distribution. ```
